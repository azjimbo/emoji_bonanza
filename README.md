Splunk Dashboard to add Emoji Code to your dashboards and/or results.



Using Unicode Characters in Splunk Dashboards
What is this?
This is a way to review how different Unicode Character will present in a dashboard.

It also provides the Splunk eval statement necessary to add it to your query.

Selecting different character sets
Use the 'Show Filters' option above then select the check box. Some of the other character sets available will present in a row below. These are grouped according to a list found here (linked on the dashboard).

The official repository for unicode is here (linked on the dashboard).

One thing I noticed is that some icons that would fit in one category appear in others (musical notes for example), So, if you're looking for something specific, you may have to dig a bit.

How to use this

If you see a character you might want to use, click on it in the table and it will present in the sample panels with both light and dark theme background colors.
Eventually, the goal is to figure out how to label these with names, but that will involve a lookup table, and right now this is just a single dashboard and not a full app.

Here's a sample of how you can use this: Sample (link on dashboard). When this opens in a new tab, adjust the 'weather' to one of the options (rain/clouds/snow) or to anything else to see the results. This should present as a single value visualization, but you can put these in any panel.


*easter egg* pick 'snow' on the "Sample" linked in the dashboard.
